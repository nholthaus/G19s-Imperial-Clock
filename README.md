1. INSTALLING
--------------------------------------------
1. Download [G19s-Imperial-Clock-Installer.exe](https://github.com/nholthaus/G19s-Imperial-Clock/releases/tag/v1.0.0) from the latest release.
2. Double click the downloaded executable and follow the prompts in the installer.
3. To make the clock available on computer start-up, add the "LCDImperialClock.exe" program to
your windows Startup folder in the start menu. The `.exe` can be found at "C:\Program Files\Logitech Gaming Software\Applets"
or wherever your logitech gaming software directory is located.
4. Now simply select the program on the applet chooser of your G19 keyboard!


2. CHANGING SETTINGS
--------------------------------------------
There are several configurable settings which can be accessed by clicking the system tray icon
on the bottom right corner of your windows task bar while the program is running.

1. Smooth Movement - turning this on makes the clock's second hand swing smoothly. Disabling it gives the
clock a 'ticking' effect. Smooth motion uses slightly more CPU than ticking.
2. Show Date - Shows the current date atop the clock. This can also be enabled by pressing 'up' on the
G19s D-pad.
3. Show digital time - Shows the current digital time below the clock. This can also be enabled by 
pressing 'down' on the G19s D-pad.
4. 24-hour time - Changes digital time to a 24 hour clock (or vice versa) when enabled.
5. Personalized Message - Shows the message of your choice near the bottom of the clock. Maximum of
29 characters (which is the width of the G19's lcd)

To exit the program, right click the system tray icon and select 'exit'.


3. BUILDING
--------------------------------------------
To build the software, you'll need 
 - Qt 5.4 or later (used for image processing/GUI),
 - CMAKE to build the makefile/visual studio project, and 
 - NSIS if you want to build the windows installer package. 
 - Visual Studio 2010 which is the only version the logitech library supports
As of writing this, the project is only really set up for windows, as I'm pretty
sure the logitech libraries only support windows. If that's not the case, the clock code itself should
be a trivial port since cmake/qt are natively cross-platform.
